## Problem statement

This project consist of recognizing ancient text written in Latin from images.

## How to run

This project was made using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). To be able to visualize the complete code and test its execution you can download the notebook from this same repository, if you don't know how to download the code you can consult: [How to Download from GitHub](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/github-download#:~:text=Click%20on%20the%20file%20you,the%20file%2C%20and%20select%20Save%20)

## Requeriments

While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook.

We recommend using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution to install Python and Jupyter. We’ll go through its installation in the next section.
